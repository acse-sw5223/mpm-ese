    "When developing software it's often the case that you'll spend as much (if not more!) time debugging, compared to writing, 'actual' code. This statement alone should make one thing abundantly clear: debugging is important and in order to increase your productivity you _need_ to get good at it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of time, as you develop/encounter code with bugs, fix them and repeat this process countless times, these are skills you will be 'forced' to acquire naturally. But as with everything, when starting out it doesn't hurt to get a few tips from sources who have spent too much time searching for that elusive typo in the middle of a million lines of code. Thus, this lecture aims to provide you with a few tips and tricks to help you on your journey to becoming a debugging guru."

    "### Infamous 'bugs'\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been some infamous 'bugs' throughout history, here are a few:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _The world's first computer bug?_\n",
    "\n",
    "On September 9th, 1947 at 3:45 p.m., Grace Murray Hopper logged in her log book the first computer bug! Her log read: \"First actual case of bug being found\". The term \"bug\" in computer science is now, of course, not taken literally. It is used to describe a flaw or failure in a computer program that causes it to produce an unexpected result or crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _The Y2K bug_\n",
    "\n",
    "The *year 2000* problem spawned fears of worldwide economic collapse, nuclear war, and led to an industry of consultants providing last-minute fixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scary stuff, but clearly a bit over exaggerated. Nevertheless, the bug was real and billions of dollars were spend world wide fixing the bug. Indeed, not all systems were fixed in time and in Spain some parking meters failed, the French meteorological institute published the weather for 19100 and in Australia some ticket validation machines failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _The Dhahran Missile_\n",
    "\n",
    "But on a more serious note, a bug in the software of an MIM-104 Patriot caused its system clock to drift by one third of a second over a period of one hundred hours - resulting in failure to locate and intercept an incoming Iraqi Al Hussein missile, which then struck Dhahran barracks, Saudi Arabia (February 25, 1991), killing 28 Americans.\n",
    "\n",
    "And here are some of the more 'interesting' bugs you may encounter while developing software:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _The Heisenbug_\n",
    "\n",
    "From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug#See_also):\n",
    "\n",
    "_In computer programming jargon, a heisenbug is a software bug that seems to disappear or alter its behavior when one attempts to study it. The term is a pun on the name of Werner Heisenberg, the physicist who first asserted the observer effect of quantum mechanics, which states that the act of observing a system inevitably alters its state. In electronics the traditional term is probe effect, where attaching a test probe to a device changes its behavior._\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _Mandelbug_\n",
    "\n",
    "Mandelbugs do not change their properties or vanish like Heisenbugs. Instead, they are so unusual and complex that there is typically no practical solution to fix them. In fact, Mandelbugs may be so nondeterministic that many scholarly developers believe that fractal mathematics inventor Benoit Mandelbrot developed the Mandelbug to drive developers insane.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _Bohrbug_\n",
    "\n",
    "A software bug which manifests reliably under a well-defined, but possibly unknown, set of conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _Schroedinbug_\n",
    "\n",
    "A software bug which manifests only when somebody debugging it finds out that it shouldn't work at all."

Since the exception occurs in a small snippet of code with in a Jupyter notebook, the information is not 'super useful', but we'll see some cases later where it is.\n",

In Python, tracebacks are reports containing the function calls made in your code at a specific point. When an exception is raised, the traceback will provide information about what has gone wrong. Tracebacks are important, and very useful pieces of information to help you debug. In python, they tend to be more helpful than in many other coding languages!"

    "\n",
    "The python debugger, pdb: https://docs.python.org/library/pdb.html, allows you to inspect your code interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically it allows you to:\n",
    "- View the source code.\n",
    "- Walk up and down the call stack.\n",
    "- Inspect values of variables.\n",
    "- Modify values of variables.\n",
    "- Set breakpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Invoking the debugger\n",
    "\n",
    "Ways to launch the debugger:\n",
    "1. Postmortem, launch debugger after module errors.\n",
    "2. Launch the module with the debugger.\n",
    "3. Call the debugger inside the module\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Postmortem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1**: You're working in `IPython` and you get a traceback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we debug the file `index_error.py`. When running it, an `IndexError` is raised. Type `%debug` and drop into the debugger.\n",

    "1. User-Developers (\"I build what I need.\")\n",
    "1. Developers (\"I make it, but I don't use it.\")\n",

    "These individuals have different needs from the documentation you provide to them. Users want to know what software can do, and how to run it for their own problems. Developers need to understand how code works, but not necessarily what it's intended for in a wider sense. User-developers need to understand both sides. Commercial software is generally written by pure developers, but a lot of scientific software (and many other small projects) is written by user-developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all groups, the most important piece of documentation in Python is the docstring, since it remains with the code it applies to, and connects to the Python online help. For developers & user-developers, additional comments in the body of the source text may also be useful, however users will probably never choose to look there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is now generally acknowledged that the best place for living documentation is in the source code, near where it applies, since this gives the best probability of developers updating it when they changes, it is still useful to maintain a proper (electronic) manual or write-up0, both for ease of reference, and to give a general project overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several tools have been developed to close this gap by automatically collating comments and function call signatures from the source code and converting it into a human readable document to label as a \"manual\". Perhaps the most famous open source, cross-language documentation tool is [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl). However we'll look further at a tool called [Sphinx](), which originated in the Python community and is the tool of choice on several large Python projects including SciPy, Django and [Python itself](https://docs.python.org/3/about.html).\n",
